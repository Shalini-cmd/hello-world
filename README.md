# hello-world
Hi, I am Shalini Mishra.
A computer science engineer who graduated in 2016.
I love solving problems. The vagueness of the problems, the uncertainty around the hypotheses keeps me excited.
I have been part of teams working on retail analytics and product analytics over the course of last 3 years
Currently an MSBA student at UC Davis, due to graduate in June,2020

Codes which I write to practice for upcoming interviews. They are generally a follow through of the book questions I am solving.<br>
For R, I generally use: R for data science<br>
For Python, I generally use: Python for data analysis<br>
